Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, specializing in software engineering and entrepreneurship. I'm passionate about building innovative solutions that leverage cutting-edge technology to make a positive impact on the world.

## 👀 About Me

From the moment I wrote my first "Hello World" program, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. But, it wasn't just about the code. It was about creating something that could change the world. I'm proficient in Python, Java, C/C++, and I'm currently diving into the realms of web and mobile app development. <img alt="Chill gif" align="right" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0578/3696/1997/t/9/assets/lofiboy.gif?v=103461765217895835051680702279" width="250" height="200" />

When I'm not coding, you might find me on the basketball court, exploring the latest in tech innovations, or sharing my knowledge and learning from others in tech communities.
