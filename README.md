Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a second-year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, specializing in software engineering and entrepreneurship. I'm passionate about building innovative solutions that leverage cutting-edge technology to make a positive impact on the world. 

## 👀 About Me

From the moment I wrote my first "Hello World" program, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. But, it wasn't just about the code. It was about creating something that could change the world. I'm proficient in Python, Java, C/C++, and I'm currently diving into the realms of web and mobile app development. 

When I'm not coding, you might find me on the basketball court, exploring the latest in tech innovations, or sharing my knowledge and learning from others in tech communities.

## 🌱 I’m Currently Working On

- TAing CSCA08 - Introduction to Computer Science at UofT
- Research at the Computational Social Sciences Lab, focusing on "Echo Tunnels: Polarized News Sharing Online Runs Narrow but Deep"
- Developing an AI-powered real-time trading system at UTMIST

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate

I'm eager to collaborate on projects, especially those focused on web development and computational social sciences. If you're looking for a dedicated teammate who brings fresh perspectives and technical skills, let's connect!
